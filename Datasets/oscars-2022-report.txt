# 2022 Academy Awards: Dramatic Moments and Breakthrough Victories

The 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, will be remembered as much for its off-stage drama as its on-stage triumphs. The ceremony, returning to the Dolby Theatre after a pandemic-altered previous year, was dramatically overshadowed by Will Smith slapping presenter Chris Rock following a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.

Despite the controversy, the night celebrated significant achievements. "CODA" made history as the first film from a streaming service (Apple TV+) to win Best Picture. The film also brought Troy Kotsur the Best Supporting Actor award, becoming the first deaf male actor to win an Oscar.

Jane Campion became the third woman to win Best Director for "The Power of the Dog," continuing the recent trend of recognizing female filmmakers. Will Smith won Best Actor for his transformative role in "King Richard," portraying the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams.

Jessica Chastain secured Best Actress for "The Eyes of Tammy Faye," while Ariana DeBose won Best Supporting Actress for "West Side Story," becoming the first openly queer woman of color to win an acting Oscar.

The ceremony also celebrated international cinema, with the Japanese film "Drive My Car" winning Best International Feature Film, highlighting the growing global recognition of diverse storytelling.
