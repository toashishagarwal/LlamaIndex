Understanding how transformed habitats act as reservoirs of biodiversity is a \\nkey challenge at a time when ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure. \\nHere we compare tree and bird biodiversity in actively cultivated and abandoned \\ncacao agroforests, and use a space for time approach to ask how this diversity has \\nchanged over 100 years of succession.\\n2. Tree and bird communities were surveyed in cacao agroforests, secondary forests \\nat different stages of succession and primary forests in the Northern Range of \\nTrinidad, West Indies, to test the prediction that there are consistent temporal \\ntrends in alpha and beta-  diversity across taxa.\\n3. Temporal alpha-  diversity was taxon dependent. We found that tree alpha- \\ndiversity increased with forest age. In contrast, there was no temporal trend in \\nbird alpha- diversity. Tree and bird species richness were negatively correlated.\\n4. Tree and bird composition varied with forest age and environmental distance. A \\ngreater proportion of native trees, and of highly forest-  dependent and insectivo -\\nrous birds were found in older forests.\\n5. Our analyses show that actively cultivated and young abandoned cacao agro -\\nforests can sustain high bird alpha-  diversity, despite lower levels of tree alpha- \\ndiversity. Old secondary and primary forests have unique species compositions \\nincluding more sensitive and specialist species. Compositional shifts with succes -\\nsional stage for both trees and birds produce a patchwork of habitats that contrib-\\nute to regional gamma- diversity.\\n6. Synthesis and applications . Our research highlights the value of actively cultivated \\ncacao agroforests and secondary forest alongside primary forests as reservoirs of \\nbiodiversity. By supporting both biodiversity and livelihoods, traditionally grown \\nshade- cacao agroforests fall within a people and nature framework. Taken to -\\ngether, these results emphasise the contributions of secondary forests, which are \\noften overlooked, to conservation.', \"| \\u20031249Journal of Applied Ecology\\nARNOLD et AL.\\n1\\u2003| \\u2003INTRODUCTION\\nGrowing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems mean that global \\nbiodiversity is being threatened in ways that have no precedent in \\nhistorical times (Blowes et al., 2019; Isbell et al., 2017; Magurran & \\nDornelas,  2010). Landscape transformation, including appropriating \\nnatural habitat for crop use, is viewed as a major contributor to this \\nongoing biodiversity crisis (Ehrlich & Pringle, 2008; Semper- Pascual \\net al., 2019).\\nHabitat transformation is not a single ‘all or nothing’ event, \\nand the way in which converted land is exploited may change with \\nfashions in food items or as a result of economic forces. For exam-\\nple, a widespread form of land conversion in the tropics has been \\nthe transformation of primary forest to cacao agroforest (Ruf & \\nSchroth, 2004). While patterns of succession and biodiversity have \\nbeen studied in other agricultural systems, cacao farming has re -\\nceived relatively little attention. Globally, many historic agrofor -\\nests have been abandoned due to ecological change (such as pests, \\ndiseases or environmental factors), fluctuating market prices and \\ncompetition from large- scale commercial agriculture (Bekele,  2004; \\nRuf & Schroth,  2004). Some abandoned cacao agroforests are now \\nbeing reclaimed for non-  intensive harvesting (Dreisinger,  2012) to \\nmeet a rising demand for ethically and sustainably sourced prod -\\nucts (Hiscox et al., 2015).\\nA key conservation challenge is to find solutions that support \\nboth people and nature (Chazdon, Harvey, et al., 2009; Mace, 2014). \\nOften conservation efforts focus on protecting untouched natural \\nareas (Chazdon, 2014). While conserving these areas is important, \\nthey may be affected by land-  use changes in the surrounding area, \\nand represent only a small proportion of forest habitats. Secondary \\nhabitat and anthropogenically altered environments cover an in -\\ncreasingly large fraction of the Earth's surface, but also have the \\npotential to contribute to conservation initiatives (Chazdon, 2014). \\nThus, there is a pressing need to understand how biodiversity con -\\nservation can be promoted, not as an alternative to human use of \\nthe environment, but as part of it. Planted and secondary forests \\n(forest which has been mostly or entirely deforested in the past with \\nevidence of the disturbance still apparent; Corlett, 1994), which ac-\\ncount for 64% of all Earth's forests (MacDicken et al., 2016), have \\nthe potential to be important reservoirs of global biodiversity. \\nHowever, in many parts of the world, particularly in the tropics, the \\ncontribution that transformed habitat makes to biodiversity is less \\nwell understood (Chazdon, 2014; Chazdon, Harvey, et al., 2009; \\nChazdon, Peres, et al., 2009; DeClerck et al., 2010). To better un -\\nderstand whether this form of habitat transformation could support \\nbiodiversity conservation within the ‘people and nature’ framework, \\nwe investigate abandoned and active cacao agroforests in Trinidad's \\nNorthern Range. Specifically we ask how the conservation value of \\nabandoned agroforests changes, with succession, over time.\\nTrinidad and Tobago is a Caribbean twin-  island nation located \\nin a prominent biodiversity hotspot (Hosein et al., 2017; Maunder \\net al., 2008). The forested Northern Range mountains of Trinidad \\nare a mosaic of primary and secondary forest at different succes -\\nsional stages following agricultural abandonment and other distur -\\nbances (Helmer et al., 2012). Tropical forests cover the Northern \\nRange. Despite extensive work by residence and visiting research -\\ners, many gaps in our knowledge of the biodiversity of this area \\nremain. Cacao farming has transformed parts of the Northern \\nRange as many of the old agroforests were periodically abandoned \\nand new ones started over time (Bekele, 2004; NATT, 2017).\", \"Specifically we ask how the conservation value of \\nabandoned agroforests changes, with succession, over time.\\nTrinidad and Tobago is a Caribbean twin-  island nation located \\nin a prominent biodiversity hotspot (Hosein et al., 2017; Maunder \\net al., 2008).

This \\npattern of transformation therefore provides an informative case \\nstudy for understanding how Trinidad's history of cacao farming \\nshapes patterns of biodiversity, and the potential contribution of \\nactively managed and abandoned cacao agroforests to biodiversity \\nconservation.\\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the patterns of tree and bird \\ndiversity through cacao agroforest secondary forest succession in \\nTrinidad (representing c. 100 years of change). We also examine the \\nrelationship between the biodiversity trends in these taxa. Insights \\nfrom previous studies of tree (Derroire et al., 2016; Finegan, 1996) \\nand bird (Arroyo-  Rodríguez et al., 2017; Buechley et al., 2015; Calvo \\n& Blake, 1998; DeGraaf et al., 1991; Keller et al., 2003; Rey- Benayas \\net al., 2010) biodiversity over secondary forest succession across \\ndifferent systems lead us to hypothesise that species richness and \\nevenness will increase over time for both taxa, mainly during early \\nstages of succession. Because trees are ecosystem engineers, for-\\nests with greater tree diversity should support a more diverse array \\nof other taxa by providing a wide- range of habitat types, microcli -\\nmates and resources (Díaz & Cabido, 2001; Petchey & Gaston, 2006; \\nWeiher, 2011). It follows that trends in bird and tree diversity should \\nbe positively correlated. Finally, as a result of this secondary suc -\\ncession we expect species composition to change (turnover) over \\ntime for both trees and birds (Borges, 2007; de Souza Modena \\net al., 2013; Derroire et al., 2016).\\nWe assess both temporal alpha and temporal beta-  diversity. To \\ndo this we first quantify bird and tree alpha-  diversity metrics (spe -\\ncies richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity, using the Hill \\nnumber framework; Hill,  1973) in relation to the time since abandon-\\nment of cacao agroforests, and benchmark these patterns against \\ndata from active agroforests and primary forest while controlling \\nfor environmental variables. We then ask how compositional change \\n(species turnover as measured by a Jaccard index) in both taxa (trees \\nand birds) is linked to site age and environmental differences be-\\ntween sites.\\nKEYWORDS\\nbird diversity, cocoa, multi-  taxa, people and nature, secondary forest succession, tree \\ndiversity, tropical forest biodiversity conservation\\n 13652664, 2021, 6, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13869, Wiley Online Library on [09/03/2025].

Active cacao agroforests (Appendix S1), sec -\\nondary forest regenerating from abandoned cacao agroforests and \\nprimary forest (areas with no indication of disturbance or human mod-\\nification) were surveyed across the southern slopes of the Northern \\nRange in Trinidad (one active agroforest being just south of the \\nNorthern Range, but managed similarly to the other active sites). Sites \\nwere chosen based on expert opinion to control for variability in en-\\nvironmental variables including land history, forest and matrix habitat \\ntype, altitude and land gradient as much as possible. We also ensured \\nthat similarly aged sites were not geographically clustered, and that \\nthe sites were spread latitudinally across the Northern Range. Site \\nchoice was influenced by our ability to obtain reliable ages, informa-\\ntion on land- use history, and where we had permission to survey. The \\nminimum distance between sites was approximately 0.8 km (QGIS \\nDevelopment Team, 2020). Sites were all 1– 5 ha, with trees over 5 m \\ntall and over 50% canopy cover. The successional age and land history \\nof each site was estimated from local knowledge and historic records.\\nThe number of years since each cacao agroforest site was aban -\\ndoned was used as a proxy for successional time. This chronose -\\nquence approach assumes that the active and abandoned cacao \\nagroforests were all managed similarly, and that the secondary for-\\nest sites are transitioning through succession at a similar rate. This \\napproach also assumes that patterns of biodiversity are driven by \\nforest age rather than by environmental factors. These factors were \\ncontrolled for where possible through site choice. Historical records, \\nincluding those held at the National Archives Trinidad and Tobago, \\nand local knowledge confirm that the active and secondary cacao \\nagroforests underwent similar management (Appendices S1 and S2).\\nBoundaries of secondary forest sites and active cacao agroforests \\nwere determined from local knowledge and landmarks, such as the cro-\\ntons (usually Cordyline fruticosa) commonly used as boundary markers. \\nSites were situated in valleys on the southern slopes of the Northern \\nRange, in lower montane seasonal evergreen forest (≤250 m altitude, \\nwith some higher altitude sites; Appendix S2; Kenefick et al., 2013). \\nEach site was predominantly surrounded by similar habitat. Historically, \\nagricultural estates in Trinidad used to be larger than they are today, \\nand often included many adjacent patches of cacao agroforest (De \\nVerteuil, 2000). Because of this, the patches of abandoned cacao agro-\\nforest in this study were largely surrounded by other patches of aban-\\ndoned cacao agroforest that were originally part of the same estate. \\nThe active cacao agroforests were all surrounded by other active cacao \\nagroforests that belonged to different land owners. The primary forest \\nsites were squares situated within a larger tract of primary forest; the \\nsize and shape being chosen so that it would be comparable with the \\nactive cacao agroforest and secondary forest sites.\\nActive cacao agroforests were planted predominantly with cacao \\nTheobroma cacao trees and some shade trees such as mountain immor-\\ntelle Erythrina poeppigiana. Most sites also included other tree species \\nsuch as mango Mangifera indica, citrus Citrus sp. and coconut Cocos nu-\\ncifera. Secondary forest sites ranged from c. 20 to 100 years old. Primary \\nforest sites, which had no evidence or record of disturbance and had not \\nbeen disturbed in local memory, were surveyed as a baseline for beta- \\ndiversity comparisons. These sites were given a conservative age esti-\\nmate of 200 years old. All but two sites were directly connected on at \\nleast one edge to a neighbouring forested area, and all sites were within \\n140 m of a larger tract of forest (QGIS Development Team, 2020).

Transects were set at least 50 m from \\nthe site edge to maximise area coverage, and to avoid double \\ncounting birds or counting birds outside the site. At each site the \\ntransect was surveyed three times, 20 min apart, at a consistent \\nwalking speed between repetitions and between sites (estimated \\nusing a GPS). The first transect was used in the analysis for this \\npaper, and the subsequent repetitions were used to assess the re-\\npeatability of the bird surveys (Appendix S3). Bird surveys were \\nconducted in the early morning (7 a.m. to 9 a.m.) when birds are \\nmore active, and the same three experienced surveyors jointly \\nconducted every bird survey (DJ, HA and Nicholas Manchouck). \\nAll birds seen or heard on either side of the transect line (up to \\n200 m) within the survey period were identified to species level \\n(binoculars were used, and sound recordings taken; for discus -\\nsion on detectability see Appendix S4). Domesticated captive \\nbirds (Numida meleagris  and Gallus  species ) were not included in  \\nthese analyses. The method and order of detection (seen, heard or \\nboth) was noted, as well as bird behaviour (flying over, flying low, \\nperched, on the ground, eating, nesting etc.) and whether a bird \\nwas directly interacting with the site (perched, nesting, feeding \\nwithin or flying low through the site). Surveys were not conducted \\nin extreme weather conditions (wind, fog or rain). Surveys were \\nconducted between late April and early August (2019), coinciding \\nwith the start of the wet season and the main bird breeding season \\n(ffrench, 1985; Kenefick et al., 2013; Snow & Snow, 1963).\\n2.3\\u2003|\\u2003Analysis\\n2.3.1\\u2003|\\u2003Environmental variables\\nAnnual precipitation, average altitude, average land gradient and \\ndistance to nearest settlement (measured as distance to the nearest \\nsettlement with >5 houses and a paved road using QGIS) were used \\nin the environmental analysis.

Annual precipitation information was \\nobtained from Fick and Hijmans (2017) WorldClim v2 supplemented \\nwith information from global climate models, digital elevation mod-\\nels and local weather stations (Spiers et al., 2018).\\n2.3.2\\u2003|\\u2003Alpha- diversity\\nAlpha-  diversity was assessed by quantifying Hill numbers of the \\norder q (species richness [ q = 0 ] ,  S h a n n o n  d i v e rs i ty  [q = 1] and \\nSimpson diversity [ q = 2]; Hill,  1973) estimates from extrapolated \\nrarefaction curves for trees and birds in each site using the iNEXT \\npackage (Chao et al., 2014; Appendix S11).

The \\nChao- Jaccard index corrects for under-  sampling and unseen spe -\\ncies by weighting for rare species shared between two sites (Chao \\net al., 2005). A quantile regression (50th quantile; Koenker, 2013) \\nwas then used to relate Chao-  Jaccard compositional dissimilarity to \\nage difference and environmental distance in pairwise comparisons \\nfor both the tree and bird assemblages. Quantile regressions were \\nchosen because they are more robust to outliers and unequal vari-\\nance (heteroscedasticity) than standard linear regressions (Cade & \\nNoon, 2003; John, 2015).\\nCompositional change was further analysed by testing for changes \\nin the proportion of native trees over succession. Information on tree \\nspecies native ranges was collated from Quesnel and Farrell (2005) \\nand POWO (2019). Compositional change in the bird community was \\nevaluated by testing for shifts in the proportion of birds with high, me-\\ndium and low forest dependence with forest age. Information on bird \\nforest dependence was obtained from BirdLife international (BirdLife \\nInternational, 2020). In addition, we assessed changes in the proportion \\nof birds assigned to the feeding guilds: granivores (seeds, nuts and dry \\nfruits), insectivores (invertebrates), omnivores (generalist diet including \\nanimal and plant foods), predators and scavengers (meat and carrion) \\nand pollinators and seed dispersers (fruits and nectar; information from \\nAcevedo- Charry & Aide, 2019; Wilman et al., 2014).\\n2.3.4\\u2003|\\u2003Concordance in diversity patterns across taxa\\nWe used a Spearman test to examine whether trees and birds \\nexhibit correlated trends in alpha- diversity (Revelle,  2015).

To understand the implica -\\ntions of these results, we first discuss temporal alpha-  diversity then \\ntemporal beta-  diversity, and finish by considering the implications of \\nour results within a ‘people and nature’ framework.\\n4.1\\u2003|\\u2003Alpha- diversity\\nAs we predicted, tree species alpha- diversity increased significantly \\nwith forest age. While other studies have found tree species richness \\nrecovers early in succession (approximately 4–  40 years; Derroire \\net al., 2016; Finegan, 1996), our results reveal that in this system \\nspecies richness continues to increase over c. 100 years of succes -\\nsion. Contrary to expectation, bird species alpha-  diversity did not \\nchange with forest age. Other studies have shown that bird species \\nrichness can increase with forest age, especially early in succession \\n(DeGraaf et al., 1991; Keller et al., 2003; Rey-  Benayas et al., 2010). \\nThe consistency of bird alpha-  diversity over time in this study may \\nbe because basic functions and structural characteristics of a forest \\ncan recover quickly and be sustained with few tree species (Derroire \\net al., 2016), and so the established trees in cacao agroforests could \\nbe maintaining core structural elements such as providing shade, \\nshelter, perches and some nesting sites. Also contrary to expecta-\\ntion, tree and bird species richness were negatively correlated. We \\nsuggest that this result arises because bird alpha- diversity is high \\neven in active and recently abandoned agroforests, where tree di -\\nversity is substantially lower.\\n4.2\\u2003|\\u2003Beta- diversity\\nCompositional dissimilarity increased significantly as the age gap be-\\ntween sites grew, and compositional dissimilarity increased more with \\nage difference than with environmental distance for both trees and \\nbirds. The proportion of native trees significantly increased over time, \\nwhich is expected as non- cultivated species naturally colonise aban -\\ndoned agroforests and gradually replace the planted crop trees which \\nare often introduced species.

Other studies have found \\nthat bird diversity changes along a human- modified landscape \\ncontinuum, and factors such as distance to urban centres, forest \\npatch size and isolation, and matrix habitat conditions (largely con -\\ntrolled for in this study) can influence bird assemblages (Brotons \\n& Herrando, 2001; Rey-  Benayas et al., 2010). For birds, common \\nspecies such as the palm tanager Thraupis palmarum , blue- grey tan-\\nager Thraupis episcopus , bananaquit Coereba flaveola  and spectacled \\nthrush Turdus nudigenis  were abundant, especially in active agrofor -\\nests and young secondary forests. Species such as the long-  billed \\ngnatwren Ramphocaenus melanurus , rufous-  breasted hermit Glaucis \\nhirsutus, red-  eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus  and the white-  bearded \\nmanakin Manacus manacus  were more common in secondary and \\nolder forests. Results from the tanglegram showed that sites were \\nranked similarly according to tree and bird composition, meaning \\nthe amount of compositional change between sites is concordant \\nfor trees and birds.\\nThese results also demonstrate that, although bird alpha- \\ndiversity remained constant, bird species composition changed sig -\\nnificantly with forest age. This is a pattern of temporal biodiversity \\nchange which has been reported across biomes and taxa (Dornelas \\net al., 2014; Pandolfi & Lovelock, 2014). Our observation that the \\nproportion of highly forest-  dependent and insectivorous bird spe -\\ncies significantly increases with forest age indicates that, although \\nactive cacao agroforests and young secondary forests have species- \\nrich bird assemblages, not all sensitive forest- dependent species or \\nspecialist feeders such as insectivores can be supported in these \\nenvironments. Other studies have found that sensitive and closed-  \\ncanopy specialist bird species, which are most at risk, are depen -\\ndent on old-  growth forests in mainland South America (Lennox \\net al., 2018). It could be that this pattern does not occur in Trinidad \\nbecause there are relatively few specialist bird species.\\n4.2.1\\u2003|\\u2003Synthesis and applications\\nConservation has historically focused on preserving pristine natu -\\nral areas and protecting charismatic species (Barlow et al., 2007; \\nBarnosky et al., 2017; Chazdon, Harvey, et al., 2009; Gardner \\net al., 2009). However, the proportion of secondary forests and \\ntransformed landscapes is rising relative to old-  growth forests and \\nunaltered environments (Arroyo-  Rodríguez et al., 2017; Derroire \\net al., 2016; Lebrija-  Trejos et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2013). Thus, \\nunderstanding the dynamics and recognising the potential value of \\naltered ecosystems is increasingly needed to maximise conservation \\nefforts (Chazdon, 2014; Chazdon, Harvey, et al., 2009; Chazdon, \\nPeres, et al., 2009; DeClerck et al., 2010). Such knowledge can in -\\nform key decisions faced in managing biodiversity, including: which \\nareas to conserve; when and how to implement restoration initia-\\ntives; how populations or ecosystems are likely to respond to per -\\nturbation; and how to measure ecosystem health.', 'Thus, \\nunderstanding the dynamics and recognising the potential value of \\naltered ecosystems is increasingly needed to maximise conservation \\nefforts (Chazdon, 2014; Chazdon, Harvey, et al., 2009; Chazdon, \\nPeres, et al., 2009; DeClerck et al., 2010).

Other studies have shown \\nthat spatial biodiversity patterns can be uncorrelated across dif -\\nferent taxa (Mandl et al., 2010; Pärt & Söderström, 1999; Wolters \\net al., 2006), with the result that one taxon cannot necessarily be \\nused as a surrogate of others when comparing alpha-  diversity be -\\ntween sites. Our work shows that this is also true for temporal bio -\\ndiversity patterns (Magurran et al., 2018). This illustrates that not all \\ntaxa will respond similarly to environmental changes.\\n4.3.1\\u2003|\\u2003People and nature: shade- cacao and \\nbiodiversity conservation\\nOur study also shows that young secondary forests and actively \\nmanaged agroforests can be valuable for sustaining biodiversity. \\nWhile tree species alpha- diversity increased significantly with for -\\nest age overall, the active cacao agroforests and young secondary \\nforests, sustained high levels of tree alpha- diversity. Furthermore, \\nthe habitat heterogeneity generated from the long history of \\ncacao farming in Trinidad can increase the collective landscape- \\nlevel diversity (gamma-  diversity) when habitat patches sup -\\nport different species (Fischer & Lindenmayer,  2005; Peintinger \\net al., 2003; Socolar et al., 2016; Tscharntke et al., 2002, 2012). \\nWe have shown that there is considerable turnover in species \\ncomposition between forest patches, and thus the patchwork mo -\\nsaic of forest types making up the Northern Range is contributing \\nto the overall richness of the species pool and maintenance of \\ngamma- diversity.\\nTraditionally managed shade-  cacao offers two canopy layers \\nand a wealth of flowering and fruiting plants, and so could provide \\nuseful habitat for birds despite being human-  managed and heavily \\ndominated by cacao trees. Research on coffee agroforests, which \\nare managed similarly, has found that ‘shade-  coffee’ agroforests \\ncan provide valuable habitat for birds and can sustain diverse bird \\nassemblages, especially in polyculture plantations and when tradi -\\ntional low-  intensity farming practices are used (Arroyo- Rodríguez \\net al., 2017; Buechley et al., 2015; Calvo & Blake, 1998).\\nThere is an ongoing debate over the best farming methods for \\ncacao, which could lead to a shift away from traditional shade-  \\nfarming methods, towards intensive monoculture systems without \\n 13652664, 2021, 6, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13869, Wiley Online Library on [09/03/2025].

All but one of \\nthe active cacao agroforests surveyed in our research were shade-  \\nplantations. Sun-  plantations can seem attractive economically \\nas the cacao trees mature more rapidly and may produce higher \\nyields, but cacao trees in shade-  agroforests live longer, may be \\nless susceptible to pests (Jezeer et al., 2017; Ruf & Schroth, 2004), \\nand shade trees can contribute towards supporting greater species \\nrichness (Araújo-  Santos et al., 2021; Jezeer et al., 2017; Waldron \\net al., 2012). There is a growing market for ethical and environmen -\\ntally responsible cacao (Poelmans & Rousseau, 2016), and tradi -\\ntional shade-  cacao agroforests can be more profitable despite lower \\nyields as the cacao can be sold for higher prices (Jezeer et  al., 2017). \\nShade trees and other crop trees can provide additional income as \\nwell. Finding agricultural and agroforestry systems such as cacao \\nwhich can support biodiversity, has utility in reconciling our need \\nto provide local income and to produce enough food and goods to \\nmeet demand, with our need to protect biodiversity and important \\necosystem functions.\\nIn this study, primary forests were distinctive in tree species com-\\nposition, even when compared to the oldest secondary forest sites. \\nThis result agrees with other studies that suggest it can take centu-\\nries for species composition within secondary forests to converge \\nwith that of old- growth forests (Derroire et  al., 2016; Finegan, 1996; \\nRozendaal et al., 2019). It is clearly important to protect primary for -\\nests due to their slow recovery. However, our findings emphasise the \\npotential value of agroforests and secondary forests in sustaining \\nspecies- rich assemblages. These habitats not only play an important \\nrole in enriching regional biodiversity but can also provide conserva -\\ntion solutions that support both people and nature.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThe authors thank Nicholas Manchouck, James Josaphat, Keshan \\nMahabir, Aidan Farrell, Ada Fontrodona Eslava, Linton Arneaud, \\nVicki Balfour and Shane Ballah for their fieldwork assistance.
